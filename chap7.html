        <!-- Section 7.2: Components of Multimedia -->
        <section id="components-of-multimedia">
            <h2>7.2 Components of Multimedia</h2>
            <p>Multimedia is made up of several core components, each contributing to creating interactive and engaging content. These components work together to provide a rich user experience across various platforms and devices.</p>

            <h3>7.2.1 Text</h3>
            <p>Text is the foundational element of multimedia. It provides the primary content and context on websites, applications, advertisements, and other digital platforms. From simple headings to complex paragraphs, text is used to convey ideas, inform users, and provide instructions. Text can be styled using CSS, making it an essential part of designing web pages.</p>

            <h3>7.2.2 Graphics</h3>
            <p>Graphics include all static visual elements such as photographs, illustrations, logos, charts, and icons. Graphics play a crucial role in complementing content, making it visually appealing, and helping to communicate messages more effectively. They can be static or dynamic and are used extensively across digital platforms for branding, advertising, and providing context to the content.</p>

            <h3>7.2.3 Audio</h3>
            <p>Audio in multimedia includes sound effects, music, speech, and other auditory elements. Audio is often used to enhance the emotional impact of multimedia presentations. For example, background music in a video can evoke particular emotions, while sound effects can emphasize actions or provide feedback on user interaction. Audio files can be embedded in web pages using HTML5 elements such as <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;audio controls&gt;</code>.</p>

            <h3>7.2.4 Video</h3>
            <p>Video refers to moving images that are often combined with audio to create dynamic content. Videos are powerful tools for delivering complex information or telling stories. Websites use video for tutorials, advertisements, live streaming, and entertainment. HTML5 introduced the <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag, making it easier to embed videos directly into web pages without needing third-party plugins.</p>

            <h3>7.2.5 Animation</h3>
            <p>Animation refers to the process of creating moving visuals by displaying a series of static images in quick succession. In multimedia, animations are used to bring a web page or application to life, making it more engaging. For example, animation can be used in UI interactions such as dropdown menus, button hover effects, or loading indicators. Animated videos are also widely used in advertising and entertainment.</p>
