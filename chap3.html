            <h2>3.1 Concept of Software</h2>

            <h3>3.1.1 Definition of Software</h3>
            <p>Software is a collection of data or instructions that tell a computer how to perform specific tasks. It can be categorized into different types based on its functionality, such as system software, application software, and utility software. Software makes the hardware of a computer operational by providing a user interface and facilitating the execution of complex operations.</p>

            <h3>3.1.2 Categories of Software</h3>
            <p>Software can be broadly classified into the following categories:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>System Software:</strong> Includes the operating system (OS), device drivers, and utilities that manage and control hardware and other resources. The OS serves as the interface between the user and the computer hardware.</li>
                <li><strong>Utility Software:</strong> These are programs designed to perform a specific task related to the management of system resources. Examples include antivirus software, file management tools, and disk cleanup utilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Application Software:</strong> These are programs designed to perform specific tasks for the user, such as word processing (e.g., Microsoft Word), spreadsheets (e.g., Excel), or web browsers (e.g., Google Chrome).</li>
                <li><strong>Web-Based Software:</strong> These applications run on web servers and can be accessed through web browsers. Examples include Google Docs, online banking platforms, and social media websites.</li>
                <li><strong>Mobile Apps:</strong> These are software applications designed for mobile devices like smartphones and tablets. Popular examples include WhatsApp, Instagram, and mobile banking apps.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3.2 Concept of Operating System</h2>

            <h3>3.2.1 Introduction to Operating System</h3>
            <p>The operating system (OS) is system software that manages hardware resources and provides services for computer programs. It serves as an intermediary between users and the computer hardware. Popular OS examples include Windows, macOS, and Linux. An OS ensures that software programs function correctly by allocating resources such as memory, CPU time, and input/output devices.</p>

            <h3>3.2.2 Role of Operating System</h3>
            <p>The operating system performs several critical functions, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Resource Management:</strong> Manages hardware resources like the CPU, memory, storage devices, and peripheral devices.</li>
                <li><strong>Task Management:</strong> Allocates tasks to the CPU and schedules them for execution. It also ensures that multiple applications can run concurrently without interfering with each other.</li>
                <li><strong>Security and Access Control:</strong> Protects the system from unauthorized access and ensures data privacy and integrity through user authentication and authorization systems.</li>
                <li><strong>User Interface:</strong> Provides a user interface (UI), either command-line (CLI) or graphical (GUI), for interacting with the system and applications.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3.2.3 Functions of an Operating System</h3>
            <p>The primary functions of an operating system include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Process Management:</strong> Controls the execution of processes, allocates CPU time, and ensures that processes do not interfere with each other.</li>
                <li><strong>Memory Management:</strong> Handles the allocation and deallocation of memory to processes and ensures efficient memory use.</li>
                <li><strong>File Management:</strong> Provides an organized way of storing, retrieving, and managing files and directories on storage devices.</li>
                <li><strong>Device Management:</strong> Manages hardware devices like printers, monitors, and disk drives by providing drivers and ensuring proper communication between the hardware and software.</li>
                <li><strong>Security Management:</strong> Provides mechanisms to secure the system against unauthorized access, including encryption, firewalls, and user access control.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3.2.4 Operating System Terminology</h3>
            <p>The following terms are commonly used in the context of operating systems:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Multiprogramming:</strong> The ability of an OS to execute multiple programs concurrently by managing their execution in parallel.</li>
                <li><strong>Multitasking:</strong> Refers to the OSâ€™s ability to manage multiple tasks or processes at once by allocating time slices to each task.</li>
                <li><strong>Multiprocessing:</strong> Involves using multiple processors to perform tasks simultaneously, improving system performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Distributed Systems:</strong> A system in which multiple computers work together to perform a task, often over a network. Each machine has its own OS, and they communicate to achieve a common goal.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3.3.2 Working in Desktop Application and Window Environment</h3>
            <p>The desktop environment in Windows includes a Start Menu, Taskbar, and Desktop, which help users access programs, manage files, and customize settings. Each application runs in its own window, and users can switch between multiple windows easily.</p>

            <h3>3.3.3 Manage Files and Folders with File Explorer</h3>
            <p>File Explorer is the default file management tool in Windows. It allows users to navigate through files and folders, organize them, and perform tasks such as copying, moving, and deleting files.</p>

            <h3>3.3.4 Customize the Start Screen and Desktop</h3>
            <p>Windows allows users to personalize their experience by customizing the Start Menu and desktop, such as changing the wallpaper, rearranging icons, or adding shortcuts to frequently used applications.</p>

            <h3>3.3.5 Installing and Removing Devices</h3>
            <p>Users can install and remove hardware devices through the Device Manager in Windows. When a device is connected, the OS automatically installs the necessary drivers. Devices can also be removed or uninstalled through the same interface.</p>

            <h3>3.3.6 Manage Passwords and Privacy Levels</h3>
            <p>Windows provides security features like password management, user account controls, and privacy settings to protect personal data and prevent unauthorized access.</p>

            <h3>3.3.7 Use of Control Panel, System Tools, and Accessories</h3>
            <p>The Control Panel and System Tools allow users to manage system configurations, access administrative tools, and troubleshoot problems. Accessories like Calculator, Paint, and Notepad are also part of the Windows ecosystem for basic utility needs.</p>
