            <h1>Creating a Digital Society in Nepal</h1>
            <p>The process of building a digital society in Nepal faces unique challenges and requires thoughtful solutions to harness the potential of technology for progress.</p>
        </section>

        <h2>What challenges are we facing to create a digital society in the Nepalese context?</h2>
        <p>Creating a digital society in Nepal faces a number of challenges, such as limited internet access in rural areas. The digital divide remains a significant issue, with urban areas having better connectivity than rural regions. A lack of digital literacy and awareness among a large portion of the population also hampers the adoption and use of technology. Moreover, there is insufficient infrastructure, and resources are often spread too thin, making digital initiatives difficult to implement on a national scale. Cybersecurity concerns and regulatory hurdles further complicate the digital landscape, preventing effective progress toward a fully integrated digital society.</p>
    
        <h2>What is computer ethics? What are the commandments of computer ethics?</h2>
        <p>Computer ethics is a set of principles that guide the responsible use of technology. It emphasizes the importance of fairness, privacy, and respect in the digital world. The commandments of computer ethics include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Respect the privacy of others and their data.</li>
            <li>Do not use technology to harm others or gain an unfair advantage.</li>
            <li>Ensure proper attribution of intellectual property.</li>
            <li>Maintain transparency and integrity in your digital actions.</li>
            <li>Respect the rights of creators and innovators.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Discuss the role of computer ethics in the formulation of a secure and reliable digital society.</h2>
        <p>Computer ethics plays a vital role in establishing a secure digital society by encouraging responsible behavior and accountability among digital users. Adopting ethical standards reduces risks related to data breaches, hacking, and other cybercrimes. Ethical guidelines also influence the creation of laws and regulations that protect users' rights and privacy. A society that prioritizes computer ethics fosters trust, enabling users to safely engage with digital technologies and platforms. Furthermore, it contributes to a culture of innovation and collaboration while safeguarding the rights and data of individuals.</p>
    
        <h2>Explain the basic principles/components of information security.</h2>
        <p>Information security revolves around three key principles: confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Confidentiality ensures that only authorized individuals have access to sensitive information. Integrity ensures that data remains accurate, unaltered, and reliable. Availability guarantees that information is accessible when needed by authorized users, promoting business continuity and operational efficiency. These three pillars work together to maintain the security and functionality of digital systems.</p>
    
        <h2>Define cyber law. What are the major fields of cyber law?</h2>
        <p>Cyber law refers to the legal framework that governs activities related to the internet and digital technologies. It addresses the rights and responsibilities of individuals and organizations in the online world. Major fields of cyber law include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Data protection and privacy laws that safeguard personal information.</li>
            <li>Cybercrime laws to regulate illegal online activities.</li>
            <li>Intellectual property laws governing digital content and inventions.</li>
            <li>Electronic commerce laws that define the legal framework for online transactions.</li>

        <h2>How do you know that your computer has been a victim of a malware attack?</h2>
        <p>Indicators of a malware infection include a noticeable slowdown in system performance, frequent crashes, or the appearance of unfamiliar applications or processes. Users may experience unexpected pop-up ads or see unauthorized changes to system settings. Other signs include files being accessed or modified without consent, and strange behavior from the computer, such as unexpected reboots or new, unfamiliar files. Identifying these symptoms promptly is crucial to minimizing damage and securing your system.</p>
    
        <h2>How can you protect your computer system from cybercrime?</h2>
        <p>To protect your computer system from cybercrime, you can take several precautions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Install and regularly update reputable antivirus software.</li>
            <li>Use strong, unique passwords for different accounts and enable two-factor authentication.</li>
            <li>Update your operating system and software regularly to patch vulnerabilities.</li>
            <li>Avoid clicking on suspicious links or downloading attachments from untrusted sources.</li>
            <li>Backup important files frequently to secure storage devices or cloud services.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>What are the advantages and disadvantages of a digital society?</h2>
        <p>The advantages of a digital society include improved access to information, enhanced communication, and increased opportunities for economic growth and innovation. Digital technologies enable faster services and can make education, healthcare, and other services more accessible. However, challenges such as cybersecurity risks, identity theft, and the digital divide persist. Not everyone has equal access to technology, and some may lack the digital skills needed to take full advantage of these advancements. Additionally, over-reliance on digital technologies could lead to job displacement and privacy concerns.</p>
